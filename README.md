# Tropic Code Challenge

Welcome! The Tropic Code Challenge is meant to simulate a real-world task that you might encounter working within our codebase.

At Tropic, we have a culture of completeness for the code we ship. This means that the code should be well-tested, documented, and should match the look and feel of the provided Figma designs.

**Once complete, please create a private Github repo and give access to:**
- jwhitmire
- lscoates
- pbcoronel
- samneely
- nbfritz
- drewblas

Include any additional information you'd like to share in the PR at the end.

## AI

We're excited to see how you design and implement the solution for this challenge so we ask that you **do not use any AI tools**, including, but not limited to: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.

## Tropic Technologies Reminder

As a reminder, Tropic uses Rails 7+, Hotwire, Tailwind, and ViewComponents. We don't expect that you're an expert with Hotwire, Tailwind, or ViewComponents, but we're excited to see what you can build with Rails.

## Setup

This is a Rails 7 application that comes pre-built with TailwindCSS and RSpec. Turbo and Stimulus are installed by default.

**Running the App**
* Install and use the version of Ruby specified in the `.ruby-version` file
* Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies and prepare the database (Postgres)
* Run `bin/dev` to start your local server (http://localhost:3000)

**Troubleshooting the App**

We expect that candidates are able to troubleshoot any setup issues. However, if you encounter any significant setup issue that prevents you from beginning the code exercise, please reach out to the recruiter and provide a description of the problem you encountered along with any additional information that can help someone troubleshoot the problem (e.g., operating system, ruby version manager, Postgres version).

## Stories

As an engineer at Tropic, you are tasked with adding the ability to import a CSV of contracts into the system. The application comes with basic `contract` and `contract_owner` models already, a few seeded contracts, and a contract index.

**Designs**: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1240366036828677673

We also expect engineers at Tropic to have a user-centric and product-oriented mindset when they're building features and capabilities. If you find any gaps in the provided card definitions, use your own product-thinking and approach to complete the requested features.

Before starting on the requested features, create a new branch. When you've completed the features, create a PR to document your thought processes and assumptions. We prefer a single PR because it's easier for us to review, but you are encouraged to note how you would approach this as a real-world problem in your PR description.

### Card 101
Add support for contracts to be tied to a specific supplier.
- A contract's supplier should always be present.
- Suppliers can have multiple contracts with various contract owners.

---

### Card 102
Add the ability to import a CSV of contract and their suppliers via a modal that is opened from the contracts index page. We've included a CSV of contracts for testing (`lib/fixtures/contracts-and-suppliers.csv`). Your solution should be able to properly handle importing this CSV with a seeded database.
- if the contract row is valid:
    - create the contract
    - also create the contract owner and/or supplier if they do not exist
- if any contract rows fail:
    - display errors for each failed row
- if a contract already exists in the system:
    - don't create a duplicate contract
    - update the contract with any new data from the CSV
- if a supplier already exists in the system:
    - avoid creating a duplicate supplier

We can tell a contract exists by it's unique `external_contract_id`.

---

### Card 103
Add a link within each row of the contracts index to the contract's supplier. The supplier view should display a table of all contracts that belong to that supplier.

---

### Card 104
On the supplier view, display an average contract value for all of the supplier's contracts.

---

### Bonuses

Feel free to choose any of these bonuses to complete after you have completed the initial stories.

- If a similar supplier name exists in the database already, use the existing supplier
  - "Access IT" and "AccessIT" should end up as one supplier, not two
  - "Timeshare Travels" and "Timeshare Travels LLC" should also end up as one supplier, not two
- Use Hotwire to avoid a page refresh or redirect when importing contracts by live streaming the updates to the page.
- Find and remove any N+1 queries in the app.
- Refactor 1 or 2 parts of the app you think could be improved. Note the refactors in your PR description along with why you chose those refactors.
